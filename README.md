# Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

This repository includes various projects focused on **machine learning** and **data analysis**. These projects range from predicting house prices to analyzing time series data, providing a great collection for learning and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and data processing techniques.

### Projects Overview:

1. **House Price Prediction (`House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`)**  
   - In this project, a machine learning model is developed to **predict house prices** based on historical data. The model uses features such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, and other relevant variables to estimate the house price. This project is an excellent example of regression modeling and feature engineering.

2. **Time Series Analysis (`time_series_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - This notebook covers **time series analysis**, a technique used to analyze data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. The project demonstrates how to use various statistical and machine learning models to forecast trends, such as stock prices, weather data, or sales predictions. It includes preprocessing, visualization, and prediction steps.

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction (`titanic.ipynb`)**  
   - The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the data science community. This project involves using machine learning techniques to **predict survival outcomes** of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing various features such as age, sex, class, and others, the model classifies passengers into those who survived and those who did not. This is a great introduction to classification problems and working with real-world data.

### Technologies Used:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forests, Linear Regression
- **Data Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM (if applicable)

### Key Features:
- **Regression**: The **House Price Prediction** project is a practical example of regression, where the goal is to predict a continuous value (house price).
- **Classification**: The **Titanic Survival Prediction** is a typical classification problem, focusing on predicting discrete outcomes.
- **Time Series**: The **Time Series Analysis** project demonstrates how to handle data that is indexed by time, and includes forecasting techniques for predicting future values.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the individual Jupyter notebooks to explore each project.
4. For the **House Price Prediction** and **Titanic Survival Prediction**, you can experiment with different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
5. In **Time Series Analysis**, you can experiment with different forecasting models and improve predictions using various techniques.

These projects will give you hands-on experience with **machine learning**, **data preprocessing**, and **model evaluation**. They provide a good mix of both supervised learning techniques (classification and regression) and time series analysis, which are essential skills for anyone interested in data science and machine learning.
